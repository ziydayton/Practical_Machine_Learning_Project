# Practical_Machine_Learning_Project
Final project for Coursera's Practical Machine Learning course

Purpose:
In this project, the goal is to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. Each particiant was asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways. (More information is available from the website here: http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har.) One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. The goal of this project is to predict the manner in which the participant performed a given exercise. 

Background:
Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement â€“ a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks.
